Below is the documentation on Appraisal Training Record Tracking System Project - database import part.

1. One-time initial setup procedure:
	These are the steps necessary to be done before the code could execute normally:
	(1)	Setup Microsoft SQL Server (2014 is preferred, although later versions should work just fine)
		HTRAINDATADEV-V
	(2) Create a database named

2. Misc:
	(1)	[new structure] "table Employee" contains a column named <CurrentStatus>, which is obtained from
		BOE's AnnualReq.xlsx (whereas most of other columns in "table Employee" is from Summary.xlsx),
		and one slight drawback is that <CurrentStatus> is "active" for all employees. This is a lot of
		duplicated data, and if BOE's AnnualReq.xlsx always behaves like this, we might be able to discard
		this column in "table Employee". However we are keeping it in the code and Database for now.
	(2)	More importantly, this seems like an error (or at least a weird thing they're doing on their end):
		in BOE's AnnualReq.xlsx, every employee at every fiscal year has "active" in <CurrentStatus>, however
		in <Status> some employees at some years have "active/inactive/terminated/leave of absence/retired/
		terminated/null". Why should an employee have "active" <CurrentStatus> but "retired" in <Status>?
