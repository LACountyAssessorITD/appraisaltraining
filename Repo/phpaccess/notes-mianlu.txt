Summary -> Employee

AnnualReq -> CertHistory

problems:

1. mdb has employees who earned temp/perm/adv certification as early as
1970/71/85, therefore Employee table needs another 3 columns tracking "which
year each person first earn their temp/perm/adv certification". Note that in
AnnualReq, fiscal year starts as early as 1996-1997, which is no early enuf to
accomodate 1970;

2.0 see pic for AnnualReq

2. AnnualReq: EarnedHours(thisyear) - RequiredHours(thisyear) = CurrentYear-
Balance, so shall we not create it and just re-generate when creating reports?
if not, then this could be a routine sanitary check!

2.1 AnnualReq: how is CurrentStatus all "active" for every single row??

2.2 AnnualReq: what does RequiredHours mean? (not consistent, don't fit in COL)

3.0 see pic for Details

3. Details -> CourseDetails for CourseNames+Location(create these 2-tuples as
columns for Courses table! then create Item# as primary key for Courses! finally
make CourseDetails rows reference Item# from Courses table!) there should be
1576 total pairs for Courses table as of current mdb file
